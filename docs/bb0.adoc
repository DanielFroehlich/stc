== Building Block 0 - Validate and prepare infrastructure
This *Building Block* is targeted to verify a given environent
before attempting to install Red Hat OpenShift.

While running this *Building Block* the following technical prerequisites will be verified

* each system having at least 2 CPU-Cores ( physical or virtual )
* each system having at least 16GB RAM
* each system having at least 10GB of Disk Storage under /
* each system having at least 40GB of Disk Storage under /var
* each system having at least 15GB of Disk Storage under empty device for container storage (e.g. /dev/vdb)
* if used, each system that need to host OCS having at least 100GB of raw disk (e.g. /dev/vdc)

Hardware requirements are based on official https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/install_config/install/prerequisites.html#production-level-hardware-requirements[OCP documentation]

=== Prerequisites for this Building Block
To be able to run this *Building Block* we recommend to prepare the
following systems

* 1 RHEL Server as *Bastion*
* 3 RHEL Servers as *Red Hat Openshift Master* incl. Infrastructure Container
* 3 RHEL Server as *Red Hat Openshift Nodes* incl. Router Container

These systems can be bare metal or virtual server running on any hypervisor.

Topology can be modified if a smaller or greater number of node is required (minimum 4 nodes).

NOTE: Please be aware that currently Red Hat Openshift expects a minimum of
2 CPU Cores and 16GB of RAM per node.

=== Steps to Perform for this Building Block

==== Download Scripts and Playbooks
With the YAML Configuration file ready, you will now have to download the
scripts and Ansible Playbooks. To do so, please run the following commands
on your *Bastion* server as `root`.

```
$ sudo -i
$ export WORK_DIR=/root/stc
$ mkdir $WORK_DIR
$ cd $WORK_DIR
$Â curl -o stc.tgz  -L https://github.com/RedHat-EMEA-SSA-Team/stc/archive/latest.tar.gz
$ tar -xzvf stc.tgz --strip 1
$ chmod +x setup.sh
```

==== Prepare Configuration File
As a first step, you need to create a configuration YAML file named `env.yml`, describing your
environment. Based on this file, this *Building Block* will perform a set of
verification steps.

To make the creation of this configuration YAML file as easy as possible,
we provided a simple script ad STC Installer for you:

Please fill in the following information into the script when prompted, default value are inside []


* Hardware Requirements: If your infrastructure respect hardware requirements
* OCP Version: Select OpenShift version, default is 3.10
* Cluster hostname (API DNS):  Hostname under which your Red Hat Openshift cluster
will be accessible after installation
Wilcard DNS for Apps: DNS-Record as entered in your DNS Server to catch all future applications
running on Red Hat Openshift
* Cluster Topology: Standard STC topology is 7 hosts, use default values to have it or change as your needs
* Bastion hostname: The hostname of jumphost to run validation and installation
* Load Balancer hostname: The hostname if any Load Balancer node to configure, this will install HAProxy on this node
* Number of Master Nodes and Masters Nodes Hostnames: Default to 3, other option is 1
* Number of Infra Nodes and Infra Nodes Nodes Hostnames: Optional, leave it blank or select 1,3
* Number of Compute Nodes and Compute Nodes Hostnames: Default to 3, other option is 1,2,3
* Proxy support: Enable proxy access for OpenShift services, Docker, Git and environments configuration
* Internet proxy HTTP: Hostname and Port of your HTTP
for outside connectivity.
* Internet proxy HTTPS: Hostname and Port of your HTTP Proxy, if one is needed
for outside connectivity.
* No proxy: Select host to skip for proxing
* Proxy username: Username in case you need to authenticate with the Proxies
defined in the previous fields.
* Install OCS (formely knows as Container Native Storage): Validate and prepare nodes for Glusterfs
* Number of OCS Nodes and OCS Nodes Hostnames: Select 3 masters or 3 nodes of your choice
* Remote SSH user: Remote user which is used to access all hosts used
for Openshift. Must have sudo access on hosts. Defaults to root.
* Red Hat account username: your accountname on the Red Hat website.
* Remote SSL user: Remote user which is used to access all hosts used
for Openshift. Must have sudo access on hosts. Defaults to root.
* How do you manage your subscription and repositories: Select RHSM for direct access to Red Hat CDN for
Subscription Management or select Satellite if present
* RHSM Username: Select your RHSM Username, password will be asked and stored in Ansible Vault later
* Satellie Org ID and Activation Key: Provide an Org ID and an Acivation Key which containers OpenShift required repositories through
a properly configured Content View

The content of this YAML will be generated in the stc directory and used by the installer, if you agreed to proceed with `y` option, the validation will start:

```
Generated configuration:

Other Example with standard STC topology (nodes contains router and registry):

```
ocp_version: 3.10
lb: bastion
nfs: bastion
bastion: bastion
masters:
- master01
- master02
- master03
nodes:
- node01
- node02
- node03
ssh_user: cloud-user
apps_dns: apps.your-ip.nip.io
api_dns: master.your-ip.nip.io
rhn_username: username
```

Example with smaller topology and infranodes, with version 3.9

```
ocp_version: 3.9
bastion: bastion
masters:
- master01
infranodes:
- infranode01
nodes:
- node01
ssh_user: cloud-user
proxy_http: 'http://proxy.company.local:3128'
proxy_https: 'http://proxy.company.local:3128'
proxy_no: 'satellite.company.local,localhost,127.0.0.1'
apps_dns: apps.company.local
api_dns: master01.company.local
rhn_username: username
```


==== Setup bastion host and validate configuration
In this step, we will be using a script to

* prepare the *Bastion* system
* verify the correctness of the created YAML Configuration file

To do so, please run the following command on your *Bastion* server  as `root` or as sudoers user.

```
./setup.sh
```

The script will ask you:

* If hardware requirements are met, if not you need to skip hardware requiments check with option: n
* Which version of OpenShift to prepare for prerequisites and verify, defaults to 3.10
* Which type of Subscription management to use in order to register hosts, default is RHSM (need access to Red Hat CDN), and also Satellite giving an Organization ID and an Activation Key

After this it will start registering Bastion host and start the validation across nodes, preparing an inventory file to be used to install OCP later on.

```

You will also be asked to provide a password to `ssh` into the 7 systems and for
a password, which will be used to encrypt all given passwords during installation
and later steps.

==== Test Ansible inventory and public key authentication
To verify that our previous steps worked and that the public keys have all been
successfully transfered to the 7 systems, please run the following

```
ansible -i inventory all -m ping
```

you should get the following output

```
master01.example.com | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
master02.example.com | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
master03.example.com | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
node01.example.com | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
node02.example.com | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}

    "ping": "pong"
}
bastion.example.com | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
[root@localhost ocppoc]#
```

==== Validate nodes and external connections for OCP
In the final step, we will run the real validation.
To do so, please run

```
ansible-playbook -i inventory --ask-vault-pass playbooks/validate.yml
```

If all steps perform without raising an error, then you are ready to
proceed and install Red Hat Openshift.
